By: `CS2103JAN2018 T15-B4`      Since: `Jan 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort Persons feature
==== Current Implementation

The sort mechanism sorts the persons list alphabetically by name. It currently supports sorting in ascending order.

The internal details of the sort mechanism is handled by the `sort` method in `UniquePersonList` class.
The sort mechanism is implemented using a custom comparator in JavaFX ObservableList `sort` method as follows:

[source,java]
----
public void sort() {
    internalList.sort((person1, person2) -> person1.getName().toString()
            .compareToIgnoreCase(person2.getName().toString()));
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort persons operation works.

image::SortingSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. The user executes the `sort` command.
. The `AddressBookParser` class parses the command and create a new `SortCommand` class.
. The `sort` command is executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. The sorted list is returned and displayed to the user.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `SortCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort persons by name
** Pros: Easy to implement and does not need to make changes for every newly added field
** Cons: Lack flexibility in sorting by other fields
* **Alternative 2:** Sort persons by other fields of a person's contact such as email
** Pros: Allows flexibility in sorting
** Cons: Might be more difficult to implement as changes need to be made for every newly added field
// end::sort[]

// tag::addpicture[]
=== Add Profile Picture feature

==== Current Implementation
Right now, a contact's Profile Picture can be viewed at the right side of the contact's profile card.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addpicture` command works

image::AddPictureSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. The user executes the `addpicture INDEX f/FILENAME` command, with parameters `INDEX` and `FILENAME`
. The `AddressBookParser` class parses the command and create a new `AddPictureCommand` class.
. The `AddPicture` command is executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. A new `Picture` object is created, containing the image referenced by `FILENAME`.
. The new `Picture` is attached to the `Person` at `INDEX`
. The new picture is displayed

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Storage of images of profile pictures +

**Chosen Implementation:** +
Store the images in a local folder. For Windows, it will be in the AppData folder, for Mac/Linux, in the home folder. +
**Pros:** +
After a profile picture is set, it will continue showing even if the image source is deleted +
**Cons:** +
Extra space to store the pictures, some images may be too large and use a lot of memory. +

**Alternative:** +
Not store the images +
**Pros:** +
No space requirement to store the images locally +
**Cons:** +
Need to ensure that the image is not deleted, or it won't display. +

**Aspect:** Putting a limit on profile picture size +

**Chosen Implementation:** +
Set a limit of 5mb for each picture
**Pros:** +
Prevents a malicious user from trying to crash the app by putting a large image.
**Cons:** +
Some pictures may be larger than 5mb. But there are various image compression services available.

**Alternative:** +
Not put a limit +
**Pros:** +
User can upload any image. +
**Cons:** +
App may be unstable if too many large images.

// end::addpicture[]

// tag::resetpicture[]
=== Reset Profile Picture feature

==== Current Implementation
We implemented a feature which allows a user to reset the profile picture back to default.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `resetpicture` command works

image::ResetPictureCommandSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

. The user executes the `resetpicture INDEX` command, with parameters `INDEX`
. The `AddressBookParser` class parses the command and create a new `ResetPictureCommand` class.
. The `ResetPicture` command is executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. A new `Picture` object is created, containing the default image.
. The new `Picture` is attached to the `Person` at `INDEX`
. The new picture is displayed

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Reset mechanism - Reset path of the existing Picture object
or create a new Picture object altogether.

**Chosen Implementation:** +
Create a new picture object. +
**Pros:** +
Easier if developer decides to change the path of the default picture, or the properties of the Picture class +
**Cons:** +
Creating a new object each time may incur some overhead, but probably insignificant on a modern PC. +

// end::resetpicture[]

// tag::findFeature[]
=== Find feature

==== Current Implementation
Right now, find feature is limited to finding by name.

It is modify such that able to find by name and tag by specifying the type to be search  after the command name `find`.

==== Implementation - Search by Name

. The user executes the `find n/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`, given the search type `n/` and with parameters `KEYWORD`
. The `AddressBookParser` class parses the command and create a new `FindCommandParse` class.
. The `FindCommandParse` will compare the search type to check if search is by name and parse the keywords to `FindCommand`
. The `FindCommand` object is created, and assisted by `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` to obtain the result.
. The  result is then return and displayed to the user.

==== Implementation - Search by Tag

. The user executes the `find t/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`, given the search type `t/` and with parameters `KEYWORD`
. The `AddressBookParser` class parses the command and create a new `FindCommandParse` class.
. The `FindCommandParse` will compare the search type to check if search is by tag and parse the keywords to `FindCommand`
. The `FindCommand` object is created, and assisted by `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` to obtain the result.
. The  result is then return and displayed to the user.

==== Implementation - Search by Address

. The user executes the `find a/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`, given the search type `a/` and with parameters `KEYWORD`
. The `AddressBookParser` class parses the command and create a new `FindCommandParse` class.
. The `FindCommandParse` will compare the search type to check if search is by tag and parse the keywords to `FindCommand`
. The `FindCommand` object is created, and assisted by `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate` to obtain the result.
. The  result is then return and displayed to the user.

==== Implementation - Search by Phone

. The user executes the `find p/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`, given the search type `p/` and with parameters `KEYWORD`
. The `AddressBookParser` class parses the command and create a new `FindCommandParse` class.
. The `FindCommandParse` will compare the search type to check if search is by tag and parse the keywords to `FindCommand`
. The `FindCommand` object is created, and assisted by `PhoneContainsKeywordsPredicate` to obtain the result.
. The  result is then return and displayed to the user.

// end::findFeature[]

// tag::addTAG[]

=== Add Tag to Contact

The add tag command inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

The `logic` component parses user inputs, while the `model` component updates the person in the Address Book.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the Add Tag command works:

image::AddTagSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]


. The user executes the `addtag INDEX t/TAG1 t/TAG2 ...` command, with parameters `INDEX` and TAG1, TAG2, ...
. The `AddressBookParser` class parses the command and create a new `AddTagCommand` class.
. The `AddTag` command is executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. New `Tag` object(s) (depending on the number of input tags) is created.
. The new `Tag` is attached to the `Person` at `INDEX`.
. `updatePerson` in `ModelManager` updates the person at `INDEX` with a new person with the added tags.

// end::addTAG[]

// tag::deletebyname[]

=== Delete Contact by Name
==== Current Implementation
The Delete Contact by Name command inherits from `UndoableCommand`.

The `logic` component parses user inputs, while the `model` component removes the person in the address book.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the Delete By Name command works:

image::DeletePersonByNameSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


. The user executes the `deletebyname name` command, with parameter `nane`
. The `AddressBookParser` class parses the command and create a new `DeleteByNameCommand` class.
. The `DeleteByNameCommand` command is executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. The person refered to by `name` is searched using the `searchForPersonByName()` method.
. If the person is found, that person is deleted
. `ModelManager` removes the person from the addressbook.

// end::deletebyname[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export feature

==== Current Implementation
It makes use of `ExportCommand` which extends `UndoableCommand`.
When the Export functionality is called on the `AddressBookParser`, it parses the given input as a FILEPATH using `ExportCommandParser` which eventually creates the `ExportCommand` instance.
The `ModelManager` then invokes methods involving `Storage` under the `Model` instance in order to store the data into a user-defined location. If such a location was not well-defined, then the XML file exported will be directly saved in your local repository's main folder.
The 'StorageManager' will then call the `exportAddressBook` method under `XmlAddressBookStorage` to store the data as an XML file into a user-defined location.

image::ExportCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Usages of Exported Data

* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Allows option of exporting data into either CSV or XML files.
** Pros: Allows greater flexibility as CSV files can be catered to importing of contacts into Google Contacts.
** Cons: Need to manually cater to popular file formats and this may require constant maintenance on the developers' end.
* **Alternative 2:** Only allows exporting of data as XML files.
** Pros: Simplified export into a file that is readable and understandable by users, is completely compatible with Java and 100% portable.
** Cons: Users may not know the benefits or uses of an XML file.
// end::export[]

// tag::calendarview[]
=== Calendar View feature

==== Current Implementation
Right now, the Calendar can be viewed on the homepage of BizConnect Journal as a summarized list of events on different days of a specified month.
// end::calendarview[]

// tag::addevent[]
=== Add Event feature
==== Current Implementation

The add event feature allows the user to add a new event into the Event Book.
The event details required: Title, Description, Location, Datetime.
All of the fields are compulsory, and the user can simply fill in a dummy value for irrelevant fields.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add event command works under LogicManager.

image::AddEventCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. User executes `addevent` command with the required arguments.
. `AddressBookParser` class creates a new `AddEventCommandParser` object to parse the command arguments.
. This `AddEventCommandParser` object parses the arguments and create a new `AddEventCommand` object.
. The `addevent` command is then executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. The event is finally added to the Event list in Address Book and the updated list is then displayed to the user.

The next sequence diagram illustrates how the event is added under ModelManager.

image::AddEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

// end::addevent[]

// tag::deleteevent[]
=== Delete Event feature
==== Current Implementation

The delete event feature allows user to delete an event in the Event Book by specifying the index of the displayed Event List.
Allows easy deletion of an event according to the event index listed in the Event list.

This sequence diagram shows how the delete event command works under LogicManager.

image::DeleteEventCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. User executes `deleteevent` command with the required arguments.
. `AddressBookParser` class creates a new `DeleteEventCommandParser` object to parse the command arguments.
. This `DeleteEventCommandParser` object parses the arguments and create a new `DeleteEventCommand` object.
. The `deleteevent` command is then executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. The specified event is removed from the Event list in Address Book and the updated list is then displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the event is removed under ModelManager.

image::DeleteEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

// end::deleteevent[]

// tag::switchtab[]
=== Switch Tab feature
==== Current Implementation

The switch tab functionality allows the user to use CLI to switch between the Event and Task tabs as shown below.
This provides additional support for users who prefer CLI to mouse controls.

Format: `switchtab`

image::SwitchTab.PNG[width="200"]

And this is how SwitchTab works!

. The user executes the `switchtab` command.
. The `SwitchTabCommand` class creates a new `SingleSelectionModel<Tab>` object using the TabPane displaying Events and Tasks list.
. The selected tab-index for the `SingleSelectionModel<Tab>` object is updated and displayed to the user.
// end::switchtab[]

// tag::task-add[]
=== Add Task feature
==== Current Implementation

The add task feature allows user to add a new task into the Address Book by specifying the required parameters.

It allows the adding of the following fields: name, priority, description, due date, status and category.
All of the fields are compulsory except category.

Format: `task-add n/NAME p/PRIORITY d/DESCRIPTION dd/DUE_DATE s/STATUS [c/CATEGORY]...`

Validations are performed for each of the fields to ensure that invalid values will result in appropriate error messages.
Some examples are as follows:

image::DG_AddTask_1.PNG[width="800"]
Task with invalid priority value.

image::DG_AddTask_2.PNG[width="800"]
Task with invalid due date format.

Furthermore, if the task to be added already exist in the Address Book, it will result in the following error message.

image::DG_AddTask_3.PNG[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the add task operation works.

image::TaskAddSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. The user executes the `task-add` command and specify the required parameters.
. The `AddressBookParser` class creates a new `TaskAddCommandParser` class to parse the command parameters.
. The `TaskAddCommandParser` class parses the parameters and create a new `TaskAddCommand` class.
. The `task-add` command is executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. The task is added to the list of tasks in Address Book and displayed to the user.

The following activity diagram summarise what happens when a user executes the `task-add` command:

image::TaskAddActivityDiagram.png[width="700"]
// end::task-add[]

// tag::task-delete[]
=== Delete Task feature
==== Current Implementation

The delete task feature allows user to delete any done, overdue or unwanted task from the Address Book by specifying
the task's index in the displayed Task List.

Format: `task-delete INDEX`

Similarly, validation is performed on the supplied index to ensure its validity.

image::DG_DeleteTask_1.PNG[width="350"]
There are 7 tasks in the list for this case.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete task operation works.

image::TaskDeleteSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. The user executes the `task-delete` command and specify the required parameter.
. The `AddressBookParser` class creates a new `TaskDeleteCommandParser` class to parse the command parameter.
. The `TaskDeleteCommandParser` class parses the parameter and create a new `TaskDeleteCommand` class.
. The `task-delete` command is executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. The task is removed from the list of tasks in Address Book and the updated task list is displayed to the user.
// end::task-delete[]

// tag::task-edit[]
=== Edit Task feature
==== Current Implementation

The edit task feature allows user to edit any fields of an existing task in the AddressBook by specifying
the task's index in the displayed Task List followed by the parameters of the fields to be edited.

Format: `task-edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PRIORITY] [d/DESCRIPTION] [dd/DUE_DATE] [s/STATUS] [c/CATEGORY]...`

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit task operation works.

image::TaskEditSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. The user executes the `task-edit` command and specify the required parameters.
. The `AddressBookParser` class creates a new `TaskEditCommandParser` class to parse the command parameters.
. The `TaskEditCommandParser` class parses the parameters and create a new `TaskEditCommand` class.
. The `task-edit` command is executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. The task is updated with the new values and the updated task list is displayed to the user.

The following activity diagram summarise what happens when a user executes the `task-edit` command:

image::TaskEditActivityDiagram.png[width="700"]
// end::task-edit[]

// tag::task-find[]
=== Find Tasks feature
==== Current Implementation

The find tasks feature allows user to search for any task whose names contains any of the specified keywords in the Address Book.
The search is case-insensitive and matches partial keyword.

Format: `task-find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

The following sequence diagram shows how the find tasks operation works.

image::TaskFindSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
. The user executes the `task-find` command and specify the required parameter(s).
. The `AddressBookParser` class creates a new `TaskFindCommandParser` class to parse the command parameter(s).
. The `TaskFindCommandParser` class parses the parameter(s) and create a new `TaskFindCommand` class.
. The `task-find` command is executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. The list of tasks in Address Book matching the keywords is returned and displayed to the user.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `FindTasks` feature

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Find task by name
** Pros: Easy to implement and does not need to make changes for every newly added field
** Cons: Lack flexibility in finding by other fields
* **Alternative 2:** Find tasks by other fields
** Pros: Allows flexibility in searching
** Cons: Might be more difficult to implement as changes need to be made for every newly added field to enable searching using those fields
// end::task-find[]

// tag::task-list[]
=== List Tasks feature
==== Current Implementation

The list tasks feature allows user to display all the tasks in the Address Book.

Format: `task-list`

The following sequence diagram shows how the list tasks operation works.

image::TaskListSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. The user executes the `task-list` command.
. The `AddressBookParser` class parses the command and creates a new `TaskListCommand` class.
. The `task-list` command is executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. The list is returned and displayed to the user.
// end::task-list[]

// tag::task-sort[]
=== Sort Tasks feature
==== Current Implementation

This feature is implemented as a default behaviour of the task list display, rather than as a command.

The sort mechanism sorts the tasks list based on status (i.e. undone to done), due date in ascending order
and priority level (i.e. high > medium > low).

The internal details of the sort mechanism is handled by the `sortByStatusDueDateAndPriority` method in `UniqueTaskList` class.
The sort mechanism is implemented using a custom comparator in JavaFX ObservableList `sort` method as follows:

[source,java]
----
public void sortByStatusDueDateAndPriority() {
    internalList.sort(Comparator.comparing(Task::getTaskStatus, (s1, s2) -> {
        return TaskStatus.STATUS_ORDER.indexOf(s1.value.toLowerCase())
                - TaskStatus.STATUS_ORDER.indexOf(s2.value.toLowerCase());
    }).thenComparing(Comparator.comparing(Task::getTaskDueDate, (dd1, dd2) -> {
        return dd1.value.compareTo(dd2.value);
    })).thenComparing(Comparator.comparing(Task::getTaskPriority, (p1, p2) -> {
        return TaskPriority.PRIORITY_ORDER.indexOf(p1.value.toLowerCase())
                - TaskPriority.PRIORITY_ORDER.indexOf(p2.value.toLowerCase());
    })));
}
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `SortTasks` feature

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort tasks by multiple fields (status > due date > priority)
** Pros: Easy identification of tasks to be done as those at the top are incomplete tasks that are due first and with higher priority
** Cons: Lack flexibility in sorting by other fields
* **Alternative 2:** Sort tasks by individual fields
** Pros: Allows flexibility in sorting
** Cons: Might be more difficult to implement as changes need to be made for every newly added field and it is
not possible for user to sort by multiple criteria
// end::task-sort[]

// tag::task-clear[]
=== Clear Tasks feature
==== Current Implementation

The clear tasks feature allows user to clear all the tasks in the Address Book.

The following sequence diagram shows how the clear tasks operation works.

image::TaskClearSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. The user executes the `task-clear` command.
. The `AddressBookParser` class parses the command and creates a new `TaskClearCommand` class.
. The `task-clear` command is executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. The tasks are removed from the Address Book and an empty list is displayed to the user.
// end::task-clear[]

=== Convert currency feature
==== Current Implementation

The convert currency feature allows user to convert from one currency to another.

The following sequence diagram shows how the converting of currency feature operation works.

image::ConvertCurrencySequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. The user executes the `convert` command.
. The `AddressBookParser` class parses the command creates a new `ConvertCommand` class.
. The `convert` command is executed and assisted by the `Currency` class.
. The converted value is returned and displayed to the user.

// tag::editevent[]
=== [Proposed] Edit an Event

The edit event feature allows user to edit an event in the Event Book by specifying the index of the displayed Event List.
Allows easy editing of an event just by using the event index given in the Event list.

This is how the edit event command will work under LogicManager.

image::EditEventCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. User executes `editevent` command with the required arguments.
. `AddressBookParser` class creates a new `EditEventCommandParser` object to parse the command arguments.
. This `EditEventCommandParser` object parses the arguments and create a new `EditEventCommand` object.
. The `editevent` command is then executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. The specified event is updated from the Event list in Address Book and the updated details are then displayed to the user.

// end::editevent[]

// tag::eventnotifications[]
=== [Proposed] Event Notifications

The app will send out notifications for an event, if the user sets the datetime for that particular event.
The `eventnotify` command takes in the event index shown on the list, and the datetime for the app to send the notification.
Using the same command again with a datetime will reset the notification datetime (i.e. only one notification for each event).

// end::eventnotifications[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

The login feature helps to protect data files by encrypting them with the user's password as the secret key.
User's access is restricted until the user logs in with the username and password.
Upon correct credential input, data files are decrypted and the user will have full access to the app's features.

. User executes `login` command with the required arguments.
. `AddressBookParser` class creates a new `LogInCommandParser` object to parse the command arguments.
. This `LogInCommandParser` object parses the arguments and create a new `LogInCommand` object.
. The `login` command is then executed and handled by the `ModelManager` class.
. The `ModelManager` class will then check for the validity of the credentials and return the corresponding command message.

// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::autoremovecompletedtasks[]
=== [Proposed] Automatically Remove Completed Tasks
This feature allows user to set a time limit to remove the completed tasks, so that the task list does not get too lengthy.
However, the user can also mark completed tasks to be kept in order to retain them.
After the specified time, the unmarked completed tasks will be removed permanently from the list.

Three new fields need to be added to the Task, namely `completionDate`, `timeLimit` and `markStatus`. +
`completionDate` : Date when the task is completed (i.e. changes status from undone to done), it has a default date when first created
`timeLimit` : Number of days to keep a task after its completion before it is removed from the task list.
`markStatus` : Indicate whether the completed task needs to be kept after time limit is over

This feature can be merged into the current task features (e.g. task-add, task-edit)
For instance, the user can directly specify the time limit and markStatus during task addition,
and updates to these fields can be done using task-edit command.

This feature works as follows:

. When a task changes it status from undone to done, the completionDate is updated.
. Every time the application is opened, it will check the current date and automatically remove any unmarked
  completed task scheduled for removal on today's date.
// end::autoremovecompletedtasks[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-before.png[width="200"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

. Modify the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to show the total number of people in the address book.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-before.png[width="500"]

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
